            Amongst all the outdoor games, cricket is my favourite and I love to play this game. It is the most watched sport in India and people have an emotional connect towards it. This sport is played by using a bat and a ball between two teams of 11 members each. Every team has its own set of batsmen, bowlers and fielders.
